[Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com) is a book I think about a lot. The premise that major institutions - work, school, prison, mental health - are broken and have major flaws seems to be an increasingly accepted premise.

I think deconstructing a broken paradigm isn't that difficult.
I think reconstructing a new one is the work of this moment.

What I find deeply hopeful about RO is the premise that we can form a new set of principles and a new paradigm for how organizations work, that feels both humane without sacrificing the ability of corporations to scale.

This feels so exciting to me. It feels like one of the questions of our generation. We know something's wrong with work. David Graeber's "Bullshit Jobs" doesn't even feel like a contentious claim anymore. But what do we do instead?
