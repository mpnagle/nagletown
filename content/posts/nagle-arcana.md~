My personal highlight was making a tarot deck generated by StableDiffusion, fine tuned to know what I look like.

Dreambooth being special, then common, in a matter of months. The foundational paper coming out in August, and then Github repos appearing in the wild, and then it now become a thing you can find a few online services to do.
