From mid 2017 to the start of the pandemic in 2020, I was the lead product researcher at [Coda](http://www.coda.io)

One thing I have told the story of multiple times since is the arc of bringing learnability in as a core value to Coda. Something I appreciate about my time at Coda is that I can point to direct, concrete product changes and tell the story about them. Product and org can work can often feel etheral, floaty, and ineffective. I want to have impact - for my work to have teeth to it. If I championed a value, but can't point to any concrete pixel-level changes, it's hard to feel like anything really changed.

# the starting point: "it's too technical"

I did a lot of baseline interviewing for Coda when I started there. The product was built around the insight that many core components of a workflow - task managers, customer lists, calendars, and charts - could be represented by a core abstraction of a data table. Then you could take a view of that table and make it into something where the data was personalized by user (i.e. "only show the logged in user their tasks from the team's task tracker") or styled into a calendar, and so on.

Coda wanted you to make a table, and then morph that into whatever you needed.

The trouble with this is that most people when describing their workflow, don't think in tables. They think of putting tasks in a task manager, or finding times in an appointment book, or tracking leads in a customer database. Much of my initial interviewing led to a comment sentiment (these were users willing to give me 30-60m of their time -- so highly motivated to engage and usually having a very positive experience): "I love Coda, but I can't share it with my "friend/colleague/partner" -- it's too technical.

Of course, a software as a service that has a key blocker to spread (organic sharing) has a challenge.

# learnability

I kept interviewing, and I also had the team read Bonnie Nardi's [A Small Matter of Programming.](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262140539/a-small-matter-of-programming/) Her argument is that people are natural programmers - they do computation all the time. Programming is hard because it's context-less. She cited examples of baseball scorekeeping, knitting, and accounting as examples of computation in the wild, where doing the work required using and manipulating a symbolic language. Her argument was that programming got arcane when it didn't have a context.

I became increasingly convinced of the problem that Coda was too technical. One of Coda's board members told me a line at a party: "software can be demoable, usable, and learnable" -- and that name for the issue I was trying to put my finger on stuck. Learnability.

# adopting learnability as a value

It might be it's own interesting to story to detail how learnability became a company wide adopted value. There are many interesting moments. I openly told a product team retreat that I felt depressed that we weren't taking this finding seriously. I lead a near-company wide facilitation where I paired people up and had them interview each other about a time they'd learned something technical (building empathy for whatever emotion was encoded in 'it's too technical.)

I remember distinctly coming back from a long weekend away to a huge Slack thread. A designer had shown a friend Coda, and started the thread. "This is exactly what Nagle has been talking about" the designer said. I was psyched to come back to a long, emotional thread about learnability that I hadn't started.

Officially I knew that learnability was being taken seriously when it was announced at a board meeting (Coda had a tradition of holding an open-to-the-company board meeting and a private exec session.) But culturally I knew it happened a few months later, at an all hands for the team focused on the document surface.

We were doing a round of checkins, and a new PM was speaking.
"I was talking to (designer's name), and he has this line about how an app can be demoable, learnable, and usable, and I think that's really where we should be focusing, and..." These were rapid, 4 sentence checkins, and he wrapped up.
The designer, knowing it was my line, turned bright red. "Um, no, that's not, that's not right."
The PM didn't even register the designer was talking. "Ok, who's next?"

I was grinning. If my already borrowed line was getting misattributed, it no longer meant it was my cause. It was the culture's.

It's freighted when something is a specific person's cause. Maybe it's just their personal axe to grind, for whatever reason.

But when it's a culture's, it gets taken care of.
