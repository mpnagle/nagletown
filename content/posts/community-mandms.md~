I think, like most humans privileged enough to be very online, I've gotten very addicted to my phone. I'm still astonished when my phone tells me I've been on it for four hours a day. "Well, I bet it logs time when Google Maps is on and I'm driving," I tell myself, someone who doesn't drive every day.

When I was in college Dad made an attempt to quit smoking. He never really quit, but I think he wanted to get off the heavily taxed and heavily carinogenic cigarettes and just smoke straight weed. Maximize the pleasure to carcinogen ratio.

I remember him keeping a bag of M&M's in the car. (Which car was it? All my memories are of him driving this big honking Dad-Volvo, a light beige. But we were on the East Coast and I don't think he brought the Dad-Volvo with him.)

The idea was: feel the nicotine itch? Grab some M&M's. Put those in your mouth instead.

Was it rerouting the dopamine craving? Re-routing the hand-to-mouth program? Who knows.

I can't tell you if it worked or not, but I remember thinking it was an interesting try. I feel like the low-level dopamine programs of eating or sleep or phone or coming or really just overall sensory stimulation get so low-level hardwired, patterned, and routinized in my nervous system, that any change of flow in the river of compulsive habit interests me.

So I've been thinking about that with my phone. How I've fallen into the typical thing. Have a phone, be addicted to a phone. Have a phone, pee with a phone. Have a phone, use the phone and night and have guilt thoughts about blue light exposure at night but don't actually put down the phone. Have a phone, keep it 3 feet or less away from me basically all the freaking time no really phone.

A friend recently told me it's the swiping sensation that our monkey bodies love, finger over smooth gorilla glass. That we map texture and pressure as distinct circuits or networks or whatever they are in our brain. That texture and pressure are as autonomous fron one another in our brains as sight and smell. And our texture mappers love the smooth, smooth smartphone glass feel.

So some of that aimless-scrolling -- a notch less dire than doom-scrolling -- has gotten replaced by Recurse Center's online not-slack (zulip) threads.

And everytime when I catch this dopamine-seeking reroute, I think of Dad's M&M's. Sugary chocolate better than nicotine. Happy programmers better than "omfg I really do not need to read another article about the guy who bought Twitter again" Twitter feed.

I like everyone know that smart phones are wrecking our attention: the medium is the message, and the message is "we're sorry but the medium of the future is slot machines?" But even with the intellectual vaccine, it's really hard to resist!

So I've appreciated online community as a starting point: when the itch to put hand to oh so swipable glass, to reach for a bag of community M&Ms instead.
