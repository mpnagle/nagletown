      <description>I think, like most humans privileged enough to be very online, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten very addicted to my phone. I&amp;rsquo;m still astonished when my phone tells me I&amp;rsquo;ve been on it for four hours a day. &amp;ldquo;Well, I bet it logs time when Google Maps is on and I&amp;rsquo;m driving,&amp;rdquo; I tell myself, someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t drive every day.
When I was in college Dad made an attempt to quit smoking. He never really quit, but I think he wanted to get off the heavily taxed and heavily carinogenic cigarettes and just smoke straight weed.</description>

      <description>From mid 2017 to the start of the pandemic in 2020, I was the lead product researcher at Coda
One thing I have told the story of multiple times since is the arc of bringing learnability in as a core value to Coda. Something I appreciate about my time at Coda is that I can point to direct, concrete product changes and tell the story about them. Product and org can work can often feel etheral, floaty, and ineffective.</description>

      <title>Reinventing Organizations</title>

      <description>Reinventing Organizations is a book I think about a lot. The premise that major institutions - work, school, prison, mental health - are broken and have major flaws seems to be an increasingly accepted premise.
I think deconstructing a broken paradigm isn&amp;rsquo;t that difficult. I think reconstructing a new one is the work of this moment.
What I find deeply hopeful about RO is the premise that we can form a new set of principles and a new paradigm for how organizations work, that feels both humane without sacrificing the ability of corporations to scale.</description>
