    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>From mid 2017 to the start of the pandemic in 2020, I was the lead product researcher at <a href="http://www.coda.io">Coda</a></p>
<p>One thing I have told the story of multiple times since is the arc of bringing learnability in as a core value to Coda. Something I appreciate about my time at Coda is that I can point to direct, concrete product changes and tell the story about them. Product and org can work can often feel etheral, floaty, and ineffective. I want to have impact - for my work to have teeth to it. If I championed a value, but can&rsquo;t point to any concrete pixel-level changes, it&rsquo;s hard to feel like anything really changed.</p>
<h1 id="the-starting-point-its-too-technical">the starting point: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too technical&rdquo;</h1>
<p>I did a lot of baseline interviewing for Coda when I started there. The product was built around the insight that many core components of a workflow - task managers, customer lists, calendars, and charts - could be represented by a core abstraction of a data table. Then you could take a view of that table and make it into something where the data was personalized by user (i.e. &ldquo;only show the logged in user their tasks from the team&rsquo;s task tracker&rdquo;) or styled into a calendar, and so on.</p>
<p>Coda wanted you to make a table, and then morph that into whatever you needed.</p>
<p>The trouble with this is that most people when describing their workflow, don&rsquo;t think in tables. They think of putting tasks in a task manager, or finding times in an appointment book, or tracking leads in a customer database. Much of my initial interviewing led to a comment sentiment (these were users willing to give me 30-60m of their time &ndash; so highly motivated to engage and usually having a very positive experience): &ldquo;I love Coda, but I can&rsquo;t share it with my &ldquo;friend/colleague/partner&rdquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s too technical.</p>
<p>Of course, a software as a service that has a key blocker to spread (organic sharing) has a challenge.</p>
<h1 id="learnability">learnability</h1>
<p>I kept interviewing, and I also had the team read Bonnie Nardi&rsquo;s <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262140539/a-small-matter-of-programming/">A Small Matter of Programming.</a> Her argument is that people are natural programmers - they do computation all the time. Programming is hard because it&rsquo;s context-less. She cited examples of baseball scorekeeping, knitting, and accounting as examples of computation in the wild, where doing the work required using and manipulating a symbolic language. Her argument was that programming got arcane when it didn&rsquo;t have a context.</p>
<p>I became increasingly convinced of the problem that Coda was too technical. One of Coda&rsquo;s board members told me a line at a party: &ldquo;software can be demoable, usable, and learnable&rdquo; &ndash; and that name for the issue I was trying to put my finger on stuck. Learnability.</p>
<h1 id="adopting-learnability-as-a-value">adopting learnability as a value</h1>
<p>It might be it&rsquo;s own interesting to story to detail how learnability became a company wide adopted value. There are many interesting moments. I openly told a product team retreat that I felt depressed that we weren&rsquo;t taking this finding seriously. I lead a near-company wide facilitation where I paired people up and had them interview each other about a time they&rsquo;d learned something technical (building empathy for whatever emotion was encoded in &lsquo;it&rsquo;s too technical.)</p>
<p>I remember distinctly coming back from a long weekend away to a huge Slack thread. A designer had shown a friend Coda, and started the thread. &ldquo;This is exactly what Nagle has been talking about&rdquo; the designer said. I was psyched to come back to a long, emotional thread about learnability that I hadn&rsquo;t started.</p>
<p>Officially I knew that learnability was being taken seriously when it was announced at a board meeting (Coda had a tradition of holding an open-to-the-company board meeting and a private exec session.) But culturally I knew it happened a few months later, at an all hands for the team focused on the document surface.</p>
<p>We were doing a round of checkins, and a new PM was speaking.
&ldquo;I was talking to (designer&rsquo;s name), and he has this line about how an app can be demoable, learnable, and usable, and I think that&rsquo;s really where we should be focusing, and&hellip;&rdquo; These were rapid, 4 sentence checkins, and he wrapped up.
The designer, knowing it was my line, turned bright red. &ldquo;Um, no, that&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo;
The PM didn&rsquo;t even register the designer was talking. &ldquo;Ok, who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was grinning. If my already borrowed line was getting misattributed, it no longer meant it was my cause. It was the culture&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s freighted when something is a specific person&rsquo;s cause. Maybe it&rsquo;s just their personal axe to grind, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s a culture&rsquo;s, it gets taken care of.</p>
